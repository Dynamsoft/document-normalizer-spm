# Dynamsoft Document Normalizer

Dynamsoft Document Normalizer (DDN) is an SDK designed to detect quadrilaterals (quads for short) such as document/table boundaries and more from images, then perform document normalization on the images in the detected quads. Document normalization includes a set of functions such as border cropping/deskewing/perspective correction/contrast and brightness adjustment, etc. Additionally, the resulting normalized image can be used for further processing such as Optical Character Recognition (OCR).
